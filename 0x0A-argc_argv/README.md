# 0x0A. C - `argc`, `argv`

I learnt about `argc` - argument count and `argv` - argument vector, which are arguments that are passed into C functions, as well as using `__attribute__((unused))` or `void` to compile programs that have unused variables and/or parameters.

# Tasks
## 0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to
- This program prints its name, followed by a new line. It also prints the name of the program if it is renamed.

## 1. Silence is argument carried out by other means
- This program prints the number of arguments passed into it.

## 2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter
- This program prints to the `stdout` all the arguments it receives on a new line.
