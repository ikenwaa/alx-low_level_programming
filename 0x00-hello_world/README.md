# 0x00-hello_world

This directory contains bash scripts and C programs written by me for the ALX-Holberton Full Stack software engineering program.

## 0. Preprocessor
This script runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result in another file.

## 1. Compiler
This script will compile a C file that does not link. The output file will be named the same as the C file but with the extension `.o`.

## 2. Assembler
This script will generate the assembly code of a C program and save it in an output file named as the same file but with a `.s` extension instead of `.c`.

## 3. Name
This script will compile a C file and create an executable named `cisfun`.

## 4. Hello, puts
This C program will print to the standard output exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"` followed by a new line using the `puts` built-in function.

## 5. Hello, printf
This C program will print to the standard output exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,` followed by a new line using the built-in `printf` function.

## 6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation
This C program will print the size of various data types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

## 7. Intel
This script will generate the assembly code of a C program and save it in an output file.

## 8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity
This C program will print exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19` followed by a new line to the standard error.
